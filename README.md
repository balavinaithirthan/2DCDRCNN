# CancerDrugResponse2DCNN
Prediction of Phenotypic Cancer Drug Response with an Image-Based Dual Convolutional Neural Network.
The model requires a one-hot encoded representation of the drugs and a t-SNE transformed gene expression matrix of cell lines. The projectdata.zip file can be created by inputting your respective one-hot encoded drugs, t-SNE transformed gene expression data, and corresponding IC50 between the files. For the data used in my project, please look at the proccessed data files. For a quick example to observe how the model works, please look at the sample data files.
